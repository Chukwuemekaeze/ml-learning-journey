## Today's Learning
- I set up git on my system and learned some git commands
- Revisited my git hum after years of inactivity there
- learned what markdown files are
- Also downloaded cursor to see what it's all about

## Code Written Today
Basically no code was written today, and I'm using this
markdown file as a way to learn documenting.

## Challenges Faced
Adjusting to learning and using git bash to interact with my 
repository because I used GitHub desktop in the past


## Tomorrow's goals
Begin actual learning of material

## Resources used
Information from AI chatbots like claude
