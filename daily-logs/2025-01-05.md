## Today's Learning
- I learned about instance variables in OOP 
- I learned how the store values that make objects INSTANCES of classes
- I learned how instance variables along with methods are collectively referred to as attributes of 
  an object
- I also learned about stepwise refinement in programming and what it entails
- finally, I relearned a bit of physics, more specifically, projectile motion


## Code Written Today
    ```python
    # This is code i got from the book and ran to try understand better
    # cball1. py
    
    from math import sin , cos , radians
    
    def main ():
        angle = float (input ("Enter the launch angle (in degrees): "))
        vel = float (input ("Enter the initial velocity (in meters/sec): "))
        hO = float (input ("Enter the initial height (in meters): "))
        time = float (input (
        "Enter the time interval between position calculations: "))
    
        # convert angle to radians
        theta = radians(angle)
    
        # set the initial position and velocities in x and y directions
        xpos = 0
        ypos = hO
        xvel = vel * cos(theta)
        yvel = vel * sin(theta)
        # loop until the ball hits the ground
        while ypos >= 0.0:
            # calculate position and velocity in time seconds
            xpos = xpos + time * xvel
            yvel1 = yvel - time * 9.8
            ypos - ypos + time * (yvel + yvel1) / 2.0
            yvel = yvel1
            print("\nDistance traveled: {0: 0.1f} meters.".format(xpos))
    main()
    


## Challenges Faced
- finding material to that would be nice to use
- having to relearn some physics to understand the program better
- still not understanding everything about the program at the end
- still adjusting to learning and using git bash to interact with my 
  repository because I used GitHub desktop in the past
- deciding if its ideal to go the perfectionist route and learn oop in general first
  or focusing on my claude guideline and my decent knowledge of python basics and
  learning any other thing as I go along


## Tomorrow's goals
- make a decision on what path to take
- write code i can actually understand

## Resources used
- Information from AI chatbots like claude
- John Zelle's Python Programming - an intro to computer science
