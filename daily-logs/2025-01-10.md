## Today's Learning
- I learned about magic methods being used to customize the way classes are created, compared and displayed
  when python operators, built-ins etc are used on them
- I about the term lexicographic order in python which is a way in which iterables are compared
- I learned about python's ternary operator
- I learned about the comparison methods like \_\_eq__ and \_\_lt__
- I learned about arithmetic methods like \_\_add__ and \_\_sub__
- I learned accessors and mutators like \_\_getitem__ and \_\_setitem__ respectfully


## Code Written Today
    ```python
    class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        """Initialize the Point with x and y coordinates."""
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        """Return a string representation of the Point."""
        point = f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"
        return point

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Check if this Point is equal to another Point."""
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    def __lt__(self, other):
        """Compare if this Point is less than another Point based on lexicographic order."""
        return self.x < other.x if self.x != other.x else self.y < other.y

    
    class Vector:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            """Initialize the Vector with x and y components."""
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
        def __str__(self):
            """Return a string representation of the Vector."""
            return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"
        def __sub__(self, other):
            """subtracts corresponding vector components from each other and returns
            new vector object"""
            return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
    
    class MyList:
        def __init__(self):
            """initializes an empty list object"""
            self.items = []

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        """Retrieve the  item at the specified index from list
        @param index: The index of item to retrieve
        @return: The item at the given index in the list"""
        return self.items[index]

    def __setitem__(self, index, value):
        """Set the item at the specified index to value
        @param index: The index at which to set the item
        @param value: The value to replace item at specified index"""
        self.items[index] = value

    def append(self, item):
        """appends new item to end of the list
        @param item: the item to be appended to the list"""
        self.items.append(item)

    def __len__(self):
        """Returns an integer representing number of items in the list.
        @return: The number of items in the list."""
        return len(self.items)



    point = Point(3, 4)
    point2 = Point(7, 8)
    
    vector = Vector(3, 4)
    vector2 = Vector(7, 8)
    
    my_list = MyList()
    my_list.append(1)
    my_list.append(2)
    
    print(point < point2)
    print(point == point2)
    print(vector - vector2)
    print(my_list[0])
    my_list[0] = 3
    print(my_list[0])
    print(len(my_list))




## Challenges Faced
- Understanding the use cases for these magic methods
- Understanding how the data given to the methods is computed
- Getting familiar with a class modelling a data structure which is in contrast to the single item 
  objects I'm used to



## Tomorrow's goals
- Abstract classes and Interfaces


## Resources used
- Xai's Grok 2
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Gemini Flash 2.0
