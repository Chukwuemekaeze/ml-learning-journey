## Today's Learning
- I learned about multiple inheritance which is where a subclass inherits attribute from multiple parents
- I learned about multilevel inheritance which is a situation where a subclass inherits from its parent which is also a
  subclass of another
- I deduced that it is good practice to initialize a subclass explicitly when it inherits from multiple classes.
  This is because the child inherits the initializer of the first superclass passed and this doesn't give room for the
  other. This then raises 2 errors when creating an object, if you use just the parameters from first parent, you are 
  told that your arguments are incomplete, if you consider both parents, you are told that you passed in too many 
  arguments. 
- I learned about polymorphism being a situation where classes behave differently with the same METHOD CALL and not just
  same method.
- I learned that there are 2 kinds of polymorphism: runtime and compile time polymorphism AKA method overriding and 
  method overloading AKA dynamic and static polymorphism
- I learned that method overriding is basically inheritance in  play. Here the parent method gives way to that of the 
  children depending on the class, and we get 2 different result from calling the same function on different objects
- I learned that python doesn't have true method overloading

## Challenges Faced
- understanding to work with constructors of parent classes when creating a child class
- getting confused on how to properly inherit  constructors from multiple parents and realizing that its better not to



## Tomorrow's goals
- magic methods
- abstract classes and interfaces


## Resources used
- Information from AI chatbots like claude, grok, gemini and chatgpt
- Inheritance/Polymorphism in Object Oriented Programming by Code with Kylie on YouTube
